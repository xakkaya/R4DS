# Exercises 5.2.1

# For each of the sample tables, describe what each observation and each column represents.
# table2: country, year, type (cases or population), count
# table3: country, year, rate (cases / population)

# Sketch out the process youâ€™d use to calculate the rate for table2 and table3.
# You will need to perform four operations:
# Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.
# Extract the matching population per country per year.
# Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.
# Store back in the appropriate place.
